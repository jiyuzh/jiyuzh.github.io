##### Abstract

Virtual memory translation has become a key performance bottleneck of memory-intensive workloads in virtualized cloud environments. On the x86 architecture, a nested translation needs to sequentially fetch up to 24 page table entries (PTEs). This paper presents Direct Memory Translation (DMT), a hardware-software extension for x86-based virtual memory that minimizes translation overhead while maintaining backward compatibility with x86. In DMT, the OS manages last-level PTEs in a contiguous physical memory region, termed Translation Entry Areas (TEAs). DMT establishes a direct mapping from each virtual page in a Virtual Memory Area (VMA) to the corresponding PTE in a TEA. Since processes manage memory with a handful of major VMAs, the mapping can be maintained per VMA and effectively stored in a few dedicated registers. DMT further optimizes virtualized memory translation via guest-host cooperation by directly allocating guest TEAs in physical memory, bypassing intermediate virtualization layers. DMT is inherently scalableâ€”it takes one, two, and three memory references in native, virtualized, and nested virtualized setups. Its scalability enables hardware-assisted translation for nested virtualization. Our evaluation shows that DMT significantly speeds up page walks by an average of 1.58x (1.65x with THP) in a virtualized setup, resulting in 1.20x (1.14x with THP) speedup of application execution on average.
