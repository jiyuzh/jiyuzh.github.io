# Research Interests

Operating Systems, Computer Architectures, File and Storage Systems

__Research Summary:__ _The goal of my research focuses on fundamentally improving the performance and scalability of modern virtualization technologies._ Today, virtualization technologies form the foundation of cloud and edge computing infrastructures. However, existing virtualization technologies for memory, storage, and even CPU have high performance overhead, especially with increasingly fast hardware. The central theme of my research is to minimize virtualization overhead to its bare minimum in order to close the performance gap between virtualized systems and native systems, without losing isolation or compatibility. I am currently working on providing efficient and scalable virtualization support for emerging software and hardware.
