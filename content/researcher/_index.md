# Research Interests

Operating Systems, Computer Architectures, File and Storage Systems

__Research Summary:__ _The goal of my research focuses on fundamentally improving the performance and scalability of modern cloud systems._ Today, cloud computing form the foundation of many critical computing infrastructures. However, existing technologies for memory, storage, and even CPU have high performance overhead and scalability issue, especially with increasingly fast hardware and complex stacks. The central theme of my research is to to close the performance gap between virtualized systems and native systems and enable scalable and flexible system software/hardware stacks, without losing isolation or compatibility. I am currently working on providing efficient and scalable support for emerging software and hardware.
